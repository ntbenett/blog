So I came across a blog post [link here] about using a git repo, a static site generator (in this case Hugo) and free hosting from netlify to recreate his blog
from a traditional CMS or Blogging platform and decided that I would give it a go.... Man I cant belive I didnt try this sooner! I spend a lot of time in the
terminal so finding something that i could mainly write from a terminal text editor as well as keep it all managed and easily accisble from any machine i may 
be on at the time with a github repo.
